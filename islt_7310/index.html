            <p>
                Hello! I am Maria Baldridge, a graduate student with the University of Missouri studying learning
technologies and design. Welcome to my portfolio! <br><br>
I have created this portfolio website to give you a brief look into my capabilities. Throughout this
portfolio you will learn a little bit about myself, and my professional and educational experiences. You
will have the chance to learn a little more about the work that I’ve done, the projects I’ve been
involved in, and my philosophies about learning and technology. As you move through this website,
you will also be able to view the products that I’ve created throughout this program. After you have
taken a look into my life and experiences, it is my hope that you will gain a better understanding of
myself and the skills that I mastered to get here.
