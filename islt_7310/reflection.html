	<h2>Personal Reflections</h2>

        <p id="text1">
			<strong>Career</strong><br>
            I have spent most of my career working in the classroom in early childhood education. After I graduated with my bachelor’s degree, I accepted a job in a preschool classroom at the LSU Child Care Center. This was my first full time experience in a classroom, and as a caregiver. I learned a lot from the children and families that I worked for and was able to take those lessons and experiences with me when we moved. My next major job change was when I joined the Head Start Program. It was an experience that was both similar, and vastly different to my previous experiences. It was in that program that I was able to develop my support skills through helping the children and families with what they needed. It also gave me a lot of experience working with a diverse group of children with differing abilities. Working in the classroom has been rewarding and has changed how I see things about the world and learning. I’m now ready to move out of the classroom, but still very much want to contribute to education and learning. The skills that I’m learning through this program will help me to accomplish both goals.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Education</strong><br>
            I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in elementary education in 2008. Now, 15 years later, I’m in the learning technologies and design program. I think a lot of the basics have stayed the same, but the level of technology has certainly grown, and with more variety. Back then, SMART boards were the standard, tablets were just starting to show up in classrooms, and online courses were the exception. Most people in college were in-seat students. Seeing these changes is refreshing and makes for an exciting time. I can’t wait to see what comes next.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Course Program Experiences</strong><br>
            My journey through this program has been an adventure. I’m only halfway through this program but I’ve already learned so many new things. I’ve learned new programs, like Tableau and Captivate, and have learned how to create many different educational objects, like an e-learning module and an ASK system. I completed my bachelor’s degree as a fully in-seat student, so online courses were something to get used to. I found that online learning was very intuitive and have loved a lot of my courses. 
			<br><br>
			<strong>Career Goals</strong><br>
            My career goals are learning as much as I can about learning theory and the various programs used to create online learning. My specific interests currently are developing educational software and games. I would love to be part of a team that creates programs that help people learn, and hopefully in a fun way.
