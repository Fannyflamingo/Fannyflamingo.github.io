            <p>
                The path that I have taken to get here today has been quite an <em>experience</em>. I was born in the
        Philippines, but moved to the United States when I was a toddler. Since then, I’ve lived in Washington,
        southern Missouri, Louisiana, and have now settled in Columbia, MO with my family.<br><br>I have always
        loved <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>creativity</strong>. These interests made the field of education seem like the perfect choice
        for me. I earned my bachelor's degree in elementary education in 2008. I worked as a preschool
        teacher for many years after graduation. I left the workforce in 2017 to become a stay-at-home parent
        when our daughter was born. It was during this time that I decided I wanted to move out of the
        classroom when I was ready to jump back into the workforce. I chose this master’s program because
        it is a good blend of my interests. My future goals are to create educational software to help people
        learn.
