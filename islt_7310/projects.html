		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p id="intro" class="text">In this section, you will find examples of my work. These artifacts showcase the skills and abilities that I have acquired throughout the Learning Technologies and Design program. Each artifact corresponds to one of the competencies that are goals of the program. Each image is a link that will take you to the corresponding artifact. You may navigate by scrolling further down this page or using the drop-down projects menu above.</p>
		
		<h3 id="a1_title">Design and Development of Learning Systems</h3>
		<h4 id="a1_desc">I am able to design and develop innovative, aesthetic, effective and sustainable learning technologies based on theory-grounded research.</h4>
		<p id="a1_text" class="text">When I was required to develop a module using a rapid authoring tool, I wanted to make something that would be usable in my life. I asked my husband, a physics professor, if there was some physics topic that he thought would benefit from an e-learning module. He said that his physics students often have difficulty in solving force problems. So, using my husband as the subject matter expert, I created this module. It’s intended use is as a supplement to teach students how to solve force problems using Newton’s 2nd law in introductory physics courses at the college level. The module utilizes animations, videos, a branching scenario, knowledge checks and remediation to teach and reinforce the steps required to solve a force problem. This module was very time intensive to make and is my most complex project in this portfolio.<br><br>

		The strengths of this module are that it’s user friendly and really breaks down the steps needed to master solving force problems. Its weakness is that to chunk the information (it’s a very text heavy subject to teach) and trigger some of the animations I needed to make a lot of the progression click activated. This made the module a bit click heavy. In creating this module, I learned how to use Captivate, plan a module, create animations, and how to incorporate feedback from classmates and my professor. I also got some beginner experience in collaborating with a subject matter expert. The changes I would make would be to try to find a way to chunk the information with fewer clicks. I would also probably use a different rapid development tool as I found Captivate difficult to use.

		<h3 id="a2_title">Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation </h3>
		<h4 id="a2_desc">I developed critical and analytical skills for data collection and evaluation and can reflect and apply these skills to assess and evaluate learning systems.</h4>
		<p id="a2_text" class="text">I will include a survey that I helped create during the front-end analysis phase of an instructional design group project. I will also include the final project document that includes my group’s plans for assessment and evaluation.<br><br>

		This project required my group to use the ADDIE process to create an educational module. Before creating the module, we performed front-end analysis by conducting interviews, completing observations, and creating a survey. We completed the analysis after all the data was gathered. We created two modules to teach educators how to use Jamboard, a Google Suite application, using that data. We also used the results from our analysis to create a plan for assessing the learners and evaluating the module. All these elements were compiled into our project document, which I’ve included for this competency. The second artifact that I’ve included is the survey that we used in our front-end analysis. I created this survey using Qualtrics. My group worked together to determine the questions we would ask. I then used what I’d learned about question/answer formatting and survey creation to develop it. We distributed the survey to teachers for one week and then I closed the survey.<br><br>

		This project required me to work in a group of 5, which gave me great experience working as part of a team. Working with so many different people, with different ideas and work styles, was valuable in preparing me to be able to complete this type of work in the future. I think the strengths in these artifacts are that several people contributed to help shape the documents. I think this made for a well-rounded project. A weakness of these artifacts was our small sample size for the survey, and all respondents were from the same school. With the time limit of a semester, not having a lot of access to educators, and the number of responses we got from that small pool, we ended up with a limited pool to collect data from. I think if I were to do it again, I probably would have chosen a different population, maybe higher ed vs. k-12. I think we could have gotten a more diverse population and opened the collaborative aspects of the program even further.

		<h3 id="a3_title">Leadership & Social Responsibility </h3>
		<h4 id="a3_desc">I developed competencies for socially responsible technology leadership.</h4>
		<p id="a3_text" class="text">I will include a data prep document I created for my learning analytics class. <br><br>

		I created this document after obtaining a dataset from UC Irvine’s Machine learning Repository to organize my information before performing analysis on the data. It highlights who the audience is, what questions the data will be used to answer, how the data is collected/acquired/stored, the data cleaning process, and a reflection on the ethics of using this data to make decisions. I was able to narrow down my focus by organizing these elements within this document. I was asked to consider whether there were any ethical concerns about my data for my reflection of ethics. I used what I had learned about ethics and technology and determined that there were some concerns about the possible use of the data.  The data includes personal, educational, and behavioral elements and I determined that there was a potential for discrimination and issues of equity and bias using that information.<br><br>

		I learned how to organize my information and prepare my data for analysis when I created this artifact. The strength of this artifact is that it is straightforward and organized. The weakness is that I feel like there is a lot of repetition. I found myself often restating some of my ideas within the document.
